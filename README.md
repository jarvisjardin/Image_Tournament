# Image_Tournament

This project is a web application that implements a custom tournament feature. Users select a category then are given two images to choose from. These images belong to an array of others that make up the category. When a user selects a picture (base on their own preferences), that image moves on the the next bracket. Once the first bracket is completed the next braket, which contains the 'winners' of the previous bracket, is started. This is repeated until once picture remains. 

Purpose:
- Can use to determine 'ultimate' favorite in a category (dog breeds, cat breeds, food, etc).

Technologies used:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
